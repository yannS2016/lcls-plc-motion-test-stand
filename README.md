# lcls-plc-motion-test-stand

Motivations and Goals

 1.) Provide a testing sandbox for people to try loading their own motion Twincat projects using the available IO. The setup will be modular, so new terminals can easily be scanned in as needed. People can bring in their own stages that they will need to use or test using the dedicated Kohzu linear motion stage that goes along with the setup.

 2.) Allow for a convenient testing ground for new motion controls features i.e. in the lcls-twincat-motion common library or more specialized applications.
